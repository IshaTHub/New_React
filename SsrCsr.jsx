comparison of **SSR vs CSR** highlighting the key differences, benefits, and use cases:
### **SSR (Server-Side Rendering) vs CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**

| **Aspect**                | **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)***                                | **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**                                |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What is it?**          | Rendering is done on the **server** before sending HTML to client | Rendering happens in the **browser** using JavaScript         |
| **Rendering Location**   | Server                                                         | Client (Browser)                                               |
| **Initial Load**         | **Faster** ‚Äì HTML is ready on first request                    | **Slower** ‚Äì Needs JS to load and render content               |
| **SEO**                  | **Better SEO** ‚Äì Search engines can crawl rendered HTML        | **Poorer SEO** ‚Äì Content might not be visible to crawlers      |
| **Subsequent Navigation**| May require full page reloads unless hydrated with JS          | Smooth SPA-like experience without full reloads                |
| **Performance**          | Fast initial load; can be heavy on the server                 | Light on server; slower first paint                            |
| **Examples**             | Next.js (with SSR), traditional web apps                       | React (Create React App), Angular, Vue apps                    |
| **Best For**             | SEO-critical sites, blogs, news portals                        | Web apps with complex UI, dashboards                          |
